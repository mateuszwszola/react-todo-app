# React Todo App

React Todo App built with React (Hooks, Context, Router) and Material-UI

You can create and manage to-do lists and items inside them

The initial app was built through the course on Udemy called "The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router)

[Link to the course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/)

I have added additional features:

- routing with React Router
- todo lists
- displaying todos based on the list
- sidebar where user can navigate to a different list, and manage them
- improved app layout
