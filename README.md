# React Todo App

React Todo App built with React (Hooks, Context, Router) and Material-UI

You can create and manage to-do lists and items inside them

The initial app was built through the course on Udemy called "The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router)

[Link to the course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/)

I have added additional features:

- managing different todo lists
- sidebar where user can navigate to a different list, create a new one, and delete them
- improved layout
